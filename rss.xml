            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>2016 heralds beginning of the "megatall" skyscraper era</h1><p>The number of skyscrapers over 600 metres high - known as "megatalls" - is set to more than double in the next few years, say experts. Skyscraper authority the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has revealed that the number of 600-metre-plus buildings in the world is set to rise from three to seven in the next five years.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6162d7ae66c7c63eb63d77e497ca469c/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dezeen.com%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F01%2FThe-Kingdom-Tower_Adrian-Smith_Gordon-Gill-Architecture-_dezeen_social.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Design Indaba 2016: Interview With Jaime Hayon</h1><p>It's four o'clock in the morning and Jaime Hayon is still going full speed, sitting on a couch in Cape Town, candidly telling us about the time he tattooed one of the world's top tattoo artists. Had he ever inked somebody before? Nope, and he never did again.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/48f86a6be147d551b27ad334ff404c5fb1ce9b36.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
